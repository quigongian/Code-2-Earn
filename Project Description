*Project Description*

Code2Earn is a subscription based web application where programmers of all levels will answer coding questions 
and receive reward points per question. When enough points are saved, points can be traded in for NFTs where
artists will be able to sell their creations at their desired price with an agreed percentage going to the company.
Code2Earn provides an environment where programmers can enhance their programming skills and be rewarded for it at
the exact same time.

My role in this project was to create the entirety of the front-end alongside configuring page routing.

This project was created and presented at Miami Hack Week furthermore representing house Hack@Campus.
